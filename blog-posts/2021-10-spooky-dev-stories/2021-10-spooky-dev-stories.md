Hello developer pal!, glad to see you here.

What about sharing one spooky story from your life as dev?, me first!

When I started to work, it was as a Jr BE dev, using `C#` and `Visual Source Safe`, there was this delivery we needed to accomplish in one week, so I started coding on Monday, Tuesday, I made a couple initial commits, the CI/CD we had that time took the changes, created an artifact minimized and optimized, deployed it to QA and that was all, everything was running smoothly.

Next 3 days, I was so focused in my work that I completely forgot to commit, 3 days in a row without committing, on Friday afternoon, I finally did, and guess what?, the panic.

Something happened that I lost all my changes, I tried to recover it in any possible way, unsuccessfully. After spending a couple hours, I went to my boss, sure that I was gonna get fired, explained the whole situation, and instead of asking me for a card box, he sat at my desk, helped me to track down the latest deploy(from 3 days ago), disassembled some minimized files(function names as `i`, return values as `x`, etc), stand up from my desk and just said `Good luck during the weekend`, then left.

After spending the whole weekend decoding and remembering what a function with signature `(a,b,c)` with a return `z` could be, and not sleeping at all, I was able to deliver by Monday.

Moral: always commit!

Thanks for reading!
