## 5 tips for dealing with tough conversations in agile

Hello developer pal!, glad to see you here.

Have you ever been working in a team, and suddenly a tough conversation with your team mate(s) is around the corner?, if you have, welcome to the team!, if you have not, be patient!, we are waiting for you!

One of these days, I was hearing an episode of a podcast and I bumped into this topic, `Dealing with tough conversations`; I heard it and it caught my attention the fact that most of the items mentioned by the speaker match in agile teams, therefore I wanted to shared the episode, some principles and the similarities which come to my mind.

## Show Me The Topics

The topics to be focused on are:

1. `Podcast Episode`
2. `Principles`
3. `Similarities`

_Disclaimer_: In this post, I share my thoughts and make a summary from 9 to 5 main points, not looking for a transcription from the episode, instead I unified some of the bullets which I think should be together for agile teams purposes.

## Podcast Episode

Not sponsoring this podcast, just wanted to shared it in case you want to hear it before reading along.

## Principles

Whether you heard the episode aforementioned or not, let me summarize: `Care` and `Candor`

In agile teams, the relation with your teammates could be established these 2 principles

- Care: values the person; he/she is not only a team member, is valuable person, someone you could end up interacting with on a daily basis even more than you do with your family and friends, and guess what?, it goes also the other way around, so let's value our teammates in the same way we want them to value us.
- Candor: values the persons potential; aside of value your teammates for what they currently are, let's value them for what they could become, as a team, we all have a big responsibility, to reach our clients expectations, and after reaching them, go beyond, alone we are not enough, but as a team we are, we can grow, learn more, expand tech and soft skills

## Similarities

### Meet privately now

In agile teams time is everything!, time for plannings, time for understand the business expectations, time for developing, time for testing, etc. When having a disagreement, discrepancy, misunderstanding, the best time to aboard it is _NOW_.

The golden rule is reach the other person(s) out ASAP in private, doing so, the scope of the conversation will be open for discussion between the parts of interest and close for outsiders.

### Assume Good Motives

Giving the benefit of doubt is a _MUST_, when you are reached by a teammate, have a good attitude, it is good to remember that your teammates are a very important part of your life, sometimes you interact with them even more than with your own family!, so it is better off to think that there are good reasons behind a meeting, a call, a chat message.

### Offer/receive specific and tangible observations explaining the consequences for the team

This is a tricky one, when you are the one reaching, keep in mind what is it that you have observed that could impact the team, and the negative impact of keeping that along; for instance, you hold planning sessions, and your teammates are not participating, what could it be an approach?:

_Observations_ =>

- Lack of participation of a key member during that particular planning
- Lack of opinions in topics related to certain critical functionality
- Business thinking everything is "crystal clear"
-

_Negative impact_ =>

- Blurry requirements when starting the design/dev/qa phase
- Misunderstandings since the creation of _User Stories_
- Client upset for not reaching the commitments

### Look for common ground

I really like this sentence, `look for common ground`.
It seems like just words, but think about it, look for something, for what?, _common ground_, it means, let's look where we are more equals and less different, lets look for a _common goal_, for something _beneficial_ for both or all of us.

Think it this way, we are a team, we are on a boat, when this boat keeps floating, we all keep floating, when it sinks, we all sink!, so let's _leave aside our differences_, let's wear each others shoes, be emphatic, and now let's look together for a target, a way to not repeat the same behavior and grow up as professionals.

### Let's size us up and give our help accordingly

The more worth I see in you, the more help I express, and vice versa.

This is tricky, but see that the previous steps are a chain for end up in here:

- if we talk as soon as a difference arise, it is because we care
- if we assume good motives from each other, is because we care
- if we flag each others points of improvement, is because we care
- if we look for common ground instead of looking for who is right and who is wrong, it is because we care
- then we can say we value the teammates(`Care`) and what they can become(`Candor`)

## Conclusion

When treating another teammates as we expect to be treated, the tough conversation is less tough and more a conversation; maybe you could have another thoughts, let's discuss in a thread below!
